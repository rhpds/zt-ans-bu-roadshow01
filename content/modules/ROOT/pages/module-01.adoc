== Welcome to the Team!

Congratulations on joining the team! This lab will introduce you to automation using Ansible Automation Platform. We'll start with read-only tasks that are safe to automate, helping you build confidence before moving to more complex automation scenarios.

== Lab Exercises

=== Exercise 1: Backing up Linux File Systems

Managing backups across multiple Linux servers is a common operational task. Ansible can automate various snapshot mechanisms whether your infrastructure is cloud-based, virtualized, or bare metal.

==== Step 1: Check Current Backup Status

. Navigate to the `aap` tab and login using the credentials above (`admin/ansible123!`)
. Click on the Menu dropdown icon (hamburger menu)
. Navigate to *Automation Execution* â†’ *Templates*
. Launch the template *Check RHEL Backups* by clicking the ðŸš€ icon

You should see that no backups are currently available.

==== Step 2: Create XFS Backups

Now let's create backups of the XFS file systems on your RHEL servers:

. Navigate back to *Automation Execution* â†’ *Templates*
. Launch the *Server Backup - XFS/RHEL* template
. This process will backup your three RHEL nodes using XFS dumps

[NOTE]
====
This backup process takes approximately 6-7 minutes. Feel free to proceed with other tasks while it runs - Ansible jobs can run in parallel safely!

==== Step 3: Verify Backup Creation

Once the backup completes:

. Launch the *Check RHEL Backups* template again
. Verify that backups are now available on each server

=== Exercise 2: Windows System Snapshots

Windows systems have built-in Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) snapshotting capabilities. While your organization may use third-party backup tools, VSS snapshots are essential for database systems as they allow backups without locking active files.

==== Step 1: Create VSS Snapshots

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* â†’ *Templates*
. Launch the *Server Snapshot - VSS/Windows* template

.Windows VSS Snapshot

==== Step 2: Verify Snapshot Creation

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* â†’ *Templates*
. Execute the *Check Windows Backups* template

.VSS Snapshot Verification

Great! The VSS snapshot has been successfully created.

==== Step 3: Schedule Automated Snapshots

To automate recurring snapshots without manual intervention:

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* â†’ *Templates*
. Select *Server Backup - VSS/Windows*
. Click on the *Schedules* tab
. Click *Create schedule*

.Schedule Configuration

===== Schedule Configuration Details:

* *Schedule Name:* `5 Min Snappy`
* *Description:* `Automated VSS Snaps`
* *Start date/time:* Leave as default
* *Time Zone:* Leave as default

===== Frequency Settings:

. Click *Next*
. Set *Frequency* to `Minutely`
. Set *Interval* to `5`
. Select *Save rule* and click *Next*
. Skip exceptions (click *Next*)
. Click *Finish*

.Schedule Details

Perfect! Your automated snapshot schedule is now configured.

== Code Reference

=== XFS Backup Automation

Here's the key Ansible code used for XFS backups:

[source,yaml]
----
tasks:
  - name: Check if xfsdump is installed
    ansible.builtin.yum:
      name: xfsdump
      state: present
    when: ansible_facts.os_family == "RedHat"

  - name: Ensure the backup directory exists
    ansible.builtin.file:
      path: "{{ backup_file | dirname }}"
      state: directory
      mode: '0755'

  - name: Perform xfsdump backup
    ansible.builtin.command:
      cmd: >
        xfsdump -l 0 -L {{ backup_label }}
        -f {{ backup_file }} {{ xfs_mount_point }}
    register: backup_result
    ignore_errors: no

  - name: Verify xfsdump success
    ansible.builtin.debug:
      msg: "Backup completed successfully: {{ backup_result.stdout }}"
----

== Next Steps

You've successfully completed the backup automation exercises! You now have:

* âœ… Automated Linux XFS backups
* âœ… Windows VSS snapshots
* âœ… Scheduled recurring snapshots
* âœ… Verification procedures for both systems

This foundation in read-only automation tasks will help you build confidence for more complex automation scenarios in the future.
