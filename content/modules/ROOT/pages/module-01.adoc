_A guide to using Ansible Automation Platform for read-only introspection and automating system backups for both Linux and Windows._

== Scenario: Introspection

Welcome to the team! Starting with automation can be daunting, but a great way to begin is with tasks that are read-only. This "introspection" use case allows you to safely gather information and build confidence before automating higher-risk changes.

First, log into the Ansible Automation Platform instance using the credentials below.

**Note** You might need to change the language on AAP if your browser has multiple languages enabled.

== Backing Up Linux File Systems

A common task for Linux servers is backing up their storage. Ansible can drive multiple snapshot and backup mechanisms, whether your servers are on a public cloud, in a private virtual environment, or on bare metal.

. **Check for existing backups.**
+
In the lab's `aap` tab, log in and navigate to the menu in the top-left. Go to **Automation Execution** → **Templates** and launch the **Check RHEL Backups** job template by clicking the launch icon (🚀).
+
The job output will show that no backups are currently available.

. **Create a backup of the RHEL servers.**
+
Navigate back to **Automation Execution** → **Templates** and launch the **Server Backup - XFS/RHEL** job template. This will create XFS dumps of the file systems on your three RHEL nodes.
+
NOTE: This backup job will take approximately 6-7 minutes to complete. You can proceed with other tasks and check back on its progress later.
+

. **Verify the new backups.**
+
Once the backup job has completed successfully, launch the **Check RHEL Backups** template again. This time, the output will confirm that the backups were created successfully.

== Creating Snapshots for Windows Systems

Now that your RHEL systems are backed up, let's address the Windows systems. Windows has a built-in Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) that is excellent for creating snapshots, especially for active databases, without locking or interrupting files.

. **Create a VSS snapshot.**
+
Navigate to **Automation Execution** → **Templates** and launch the **Server Backup - VSS/Windows** job template.
+

. **Confirm the VSS snapshot.**
+
Once completed, navigate back to **Automation Execution** → **Templates** and run the **Check Windows Backups** job template.
+
The output will confirm that the VSS snapshot was created successfully.
+

. **Schedule recurring snapshots.**
+
To run these snapshots automatically, you can create a schedule. Navigate to **Automation Execution** → **Templates** and click on the name of the **Server Backup - VSS/Windows** template.
+
Go to the **Schedules** tab and click **Create schedule**.
+
image::win-shed.png[Creating a new schedule for a job template, opts="border"]
+
Configure the schedule with the following details:
+
* **Schedule Name:** `2 Min Snappy`
* **Description:** `Automated VSS Snaps`
* **Frequency:** `Minutely`
* **Interval:** `2`
+
Click **Save Rule** before proceeding.
Click **Next** through the rules and exceptions panes, and then click **Finish** to save the schedule. Your snapshots will now run automatically every five minutes.

== Appendix: Code Snippets for Review

If you're interested, here are some key code snippets from the XFS backup playbook.

[source,yaml]
----
tasks:

- name: Check if xfsdump is installed
  ansible.builtin.yum:
    name: xfsdump
    state: present
  when: ansible_facts.os_family == "RedHat"

- name: Ensure the backup directory exists
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: "{{ backup_file | dirname }}"
    state: directory
    mode: '0755'

- name: Perform xfsdump backup
  ansible.builtin.command:
    cmd: >
      xfsdump -l 0 -L {{ backup_label }}
      -f {{ backup_file }} {{ xfs_mount_point }}
  register: backup_result
  ignore_errors: no

- name: Verify xfsdump success
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    msg: "Backup completed successfully: {{ backup_result.stdout }}"
