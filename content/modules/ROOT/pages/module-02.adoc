= Infrastructure Data Gathering with Ansible
:toc:
:toc-placement: auto

== Introduction

Gathering comprehensive data about your infrastructure is one of the best starting points for automation with Ansible. While you know you have servers and networks, auditing and collecting all system data can be a massive undertaking. Fortunately, Ansible excels at this task and can scale to handle infrastructure of any size.

This lab will guide you through using Ansible to collect system information, generate reports, and perform compliance audits across your infrastructure.

== Lab Exercises

=== Exercise 1: Gathering Server Information

Let's start by collecting detailed system facts from individual servers using Ansible's built-in capabilities.

==== Step 1: Access the Inventory

. Navigate to your lab `aap` tab and login using the credentials above
. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Infrastructure* → *Inventories*
. Select the *Video Platform Inventory*
. Click on the *Hosts* tab

This inventory contains the systems we'll be automating. You should see several hosts already configured for you.

==== Step 2: Run Ad-hoc Commands

We'll use Ansible Automation Platform's ad-hoc command feature to gather system facts:

. Select the host `node01`
. Click on *Run command*
. From the module dropdown list, select the *Setup* module
. Click *Next*

==== Step 3: Configure Execution Environment

. Select the *Default execution environment* from the dropdown
. Click *Next*

==== Step 4: Choose Credentials

. Select the *Application Nodes* credential
. Click *Next*
. Click *Finish* to execute the command

==== Step 5: Review System Facts

Once the command executes, you'll see comprehensive system facts displayed. This includes all the information Ansible can automatically gather from the target system.

[NOTE]
====
The Setup module collects extensive system information including hardware details, network configuration, installed packages, and operating system specifics. This data forms the foundation for infrastructure automation and reporting.

=== Exercise 2: Generating Infrastructure Reports at Scale

Now let's leverage Ansible's templating capabilities to create dynamic reports based on collected facts and task results.

==== Understanding Infrastructure Awareness

Infrastructure awareness is crucial for effective IT operations. Ansible makes this easy by combining fact collection with Jinja templating to generate comprehensive, dynamic reports.

==== Step 1: Generate Application Server Report

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Execute the *Application Server Report* template
. When prompted with options, click *All*

This template will collect information from all your application servers and generate a comprehensive report.

==== Step 2: View the Generated Report

. Once the template execution completes, navigate to the *Report Server* tab
. Refresh the page to see the newly generated report

Notice that the report includes backup information alongside system details, providing a holistic view of your infrastructure status.

[TIP]
====
You can re-run the report template and select different options to create targeted reports for specific criteria or server subsets.

=== Exercise 3: Compliance Reporting with OpenSCAP

Security compliance is a critical requirement for most organizations. Let's generate a compliance report using OpenSCAP integration.

==== Background: Why Compliance Reports Matter

Information Security teams require regular compliance reports to ensure systems meet organizational and regulatory requirements. Ansible can automate OpenSCAP scans to provide these reports consistently and at scale.

==== Step 1: Generate Compliance Report

Security has specifically requested a compliance report for `Node02`. Let's fulfill this request:

. Navigate to *Automation Execution* → *Templates*
. Execute the *OpenSCAP Report* template

==== Step 2: Access Compliance Results

. Once the job completes, navigate to the *Compliance Report* tab
. You'll see the generated compliance report files

.Compliance Report Directory

==== Step 3: Review Detailed Results

Click on the report file to view the detailed compliance results, including:

- Security control assessments
- Pass/fail status for each check
- Remediation recommendations
- Risk severity levels

=== OpenSCAP Automation Implementation

Here's the key Ansible code used for automated compliance reporting:
